# NOTE: heavy packages (TensorFlow, PyTorch/CUDA builds, torchvision)
# are intentionally not fully pinned here to avoid dependency resolution
# conflicts during an automated install. Install them manually according
# to your environment (CPU vs GPU) following the README instructions.

# Optional / manual installs:
# tensorflow (CPU/GPU): see README
# torch & torchvision: see README
# gym, oct2py, streamlit, datasets: can be installed as needed
